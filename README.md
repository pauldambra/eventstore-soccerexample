========================

Simple example for me to learn to use event sourcing. 

Download the binaries from http://geteventstore.com/ and extract to a location of your choice. 

Open the command prompt and navigate to this location. Run the eventstore using the following command:

EventStore.SingleNode.exe --db ./ESData
